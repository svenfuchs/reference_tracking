# Simple mechanism to track calls on methods.
# 
# Include the module and call track_methods(an_array, :foo, :bar) on any object.
# This will set up the methods :foo and :bar on the object's metaclass. 
#
# When the method :foo is called for the first time this is recorded to the 
# given array and the method is removed from the metaclass (so it only records 
# the) first call. The given array will then equal [[the_object, :foo]].

    #   MethodCallTracker.new controller, :'@foo', :bar, { :'@baz' => [:buz] }

    # would set up access tracking for the controller's ivar @foo, the method :bar 
    # and the method :buz on the ivar @baz.
